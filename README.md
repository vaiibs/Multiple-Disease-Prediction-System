Disease Predictions: The app predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease using health data provided by the user.

Datasets Used for Model Training:

      Diabetes: 
      Heart Disease:
      Parkinson’s Disease: 
      
Model Training: Machine learning models (Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) were trained on datasets.

Pickle Files: The trained models were saved as pickle files.

    diabetes_model.sav
    heart_disease_model.sav
    parkinsons_model.sav
    
Streamlit App: The app interface is built using Streamlit to allow users to input their health data and receive predictions. The app loads the trained models from the pickle files for real-time prediction.
